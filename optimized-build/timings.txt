 - Using @time on the solving loop in SiStER_MAIN.jl:
    -> 64.284395 seconds (459.54 M allocations: 41.570 GiB, 6.95% gc time, 52.94% compilation time: <1% of which was recompilation)
    -> Reduces to roughly 27 sec/loop after one loop (still much too slow) -> speed up due to compilation time

Functions to optimize first:
    - SiStER_interp_phases_to_normal_nodes
    - SiStER_interp_phases_to_shear_nodes
    - SiStER_interp_markers_to_normal_nodes
    - SiStER_interp_markers_to_shear_nodes
